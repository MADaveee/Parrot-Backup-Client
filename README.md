# Parrot-Backup-Client
A gui program, which backups your selected directorys including your files. 
You can select one backup-directory and multible other directorys which are going to be backuped.

The installer only work if you create a folder named "Parrot-Backup-Client-Installer" in the "Downloads" directory and the images have to be stored in a subdirectory named images.

If you download this project please make sure that you put the files in the right location. (the right path can be found in the Installer- and FileHandler class)

I did not wrote all of the code on my own, to copy the direcotry including the files I used the FileUtils class from the apache commons-io library.

I hope you have fun with my code. If there are any questions you can reach me at dc. (my contacts are in my discription)
